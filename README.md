# Google Case Study 2 - How to Improve Bellabeat's Marketing Strategy

This case stury is one of the final task in the Google Data Analytics course. My work aims to improve Bellabeat's marketing strategy using the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data.

Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women that wants to expand its market share in the global smart device market. My task was to analyze the FitBit dataset to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices and I applied these insights to the Bellabeat app to guide the company's marketing strategy. By using public data provided by FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, I aimed to identify trends, such as the positive correlation between the number of steps taken and the amount of calories burned, the slight difference in step-taking behavior between weekdays and weekends, and the impact of weight on calorie burn using RStudio. The main goal of the case study is to help Bellabetâ€™s business and marketing goals.
